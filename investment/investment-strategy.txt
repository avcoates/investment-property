What should my first proeprty be given the current market?

Given Facts
 - It is a sellers market, offers are closing above asking price.
 - It is speculated that we are and have been in a peak for real estate for many years.

Appreciation is speculation
My goal is to find a property that wil cashflow the most after I move out in a year.
This means I will be looking for a proeprty in a C/D neighborhood. 
The goal is to get in, save money on my own rental expense, collect cashflow, move and do
the same thing in a B neighborhood.
